Erlang does not truncate reductions when they have exceeded 4294967295. The 
erlNodeReductions OID in OTP-MIB is set as Counter32. If the value is not 
truncated SNMP walks to this object fail:
Error in packet.
Reason: (genError) A general failure occured
Failed object: OTP-MIB::erlNodeReductions.1


Erlang throws the following error:
